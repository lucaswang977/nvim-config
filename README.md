# My Neovim Configuration Setup from Scratch

## Current state
- Minimalist option settings, key mappings
- Leader key is remapped to <space>
- Lazy.nvim is the plugin management
- Tokyonight theme
- lualine, bufferline
- nvim-tree for file explorer (with bbye to avoid the buffer close focusing problem)
- Telescope for file searches
- Autopair, indentline, alpha 
- leap for fast moving
- lsp-zero for LSP
- Line / block moving
